This library has been ported to Maple boards, ESP32 boards, Arduino DUEs even to strom32 BGC v1.31, so I hope to be able to support much more boards in future. ðŸ˜ƒ

## STM32 boards support
The STM32 boards are supported using the [STM32Duino package](https://github.com/stm32duino), it is completely open-source and can be installed directly through the `Arduino Board Manager`.
Please check the [STM32Duino wiki](https://github.com/stm32duino/wiki/wiki/Getting-Started) to see a detailed guide how to install the package and all its functionalities.

## Choosing the microcontroller
Even though all the MCUs from the table above (and many more) are supported in the library and all of the will work with most of the BLDC motors+BLDC driver+sensor combinations, their performance will not be the same. So here is a quick guide how to choose which MCU to use.

MCU | `loopFOC() + move()` - encoder | `loopFOC() + move()` - magnetic sensor SPI | `loopFOC() + move()` - magnetic sensor I2C
--- | --- | --- | --- |
HMBGC V2.2 | 800us (ipr = 0),  ~10ms (ipr > 10000) | (doesn't support SPI) | 1100us
Arduino UNO | 800us (ipr = 0),  ~10ms (ipr > 20000) | 1200us | 1100us
Stm32 Bluepill | 200us (ipr = 0), ~1ms (ipr > 50000) | 300us | to be tested
Stm32 Nucleo-64 | 100us (ipr = 0), ~500us (ipr > 50000) | 200us | to be tested

*ipr = interrupt callbacks per second.


In the table above you can a comparison of the execution times of the FOC loop for different MCUs. When you are deciding which MCU to use with your project please make sure that your loop execution time `loopFOC() + move()`, in the worst case, will not be greater 3-4ms. And for optimal performance your loop time should be under 2ms. Make sure to account for multiple motors.

### Gimbal controllers
Gimbal controllers are the most simple and surely the cheapest solution for running FOC algorithm with your gimbal motor. They are perfect for smooth position/velocity controlling two BLDC motors with sensors if you don't have high constraints on dynamics. Their main disadvantage is that they use all the external interrupt pins for PWM signals and therefore you cannot access them from outside. That would mean that even if you only need one motor (3PWMs) you will still not be able to use pin `2` and `3` for encoder `A` and `B` signals. This means, if you are planing to use encoders with these boards you will need to use software interrupts. The good news is that this will work, the bad news is that the performance of counting encoder signals will be impaired. So I would suggest you to use Magnetic sensors with communication interface (SPI, I2C...) with these boards if possible.  

Don't let this discourage you from using the gimbal controllers with FOC, just be aware of possible side-effects when deciding which motor and sensor to use. 

<blockquote class="warning"> Make sure your gimbal controller has communication interface pins you need, available before buying it. </blockquote>

### Arduino UNO and MEGA
Arduino UNO and Arduino MEGA are probably the most commonly used with this library. The simplicity of using these boards si incomparable. If you are planning to run this library with the Arduino UNO I would certainly suggest you to think about using Magnetic sensors instead of encoders. Encoders are highly inefficient sensors (at least their implementation for Arduino UNO & MEGA) and due to constant counting the interrupt signals of the encoder produces a large difference of execution time depending on velocities you are driving your motor. 

<blockquote class="warning">
<p class="heading">Encoder CPR: Rule of thumb for Arduino UNO/MEGA</p>
For Arduino UNO, the maximum number of pulses/second should not exceed 20,000. After this value it start to have execution issues. 
Please take this in consideration when choosing the encoder and especially if using more than one motor.<br>
<p class="heading">Example</p>
If your CPR value is 10000, you will be able to spin your motor with max velocity 120rpm - 2 rotations/second 
</blockquote>

Additionally Arduino UNO has only two encoder interrupt pins and if you are running two motors with encoders on your Arduino UNO you will be forced to use software interrupt callback which introduce additional augmentation in execution times. Arduino MEGA has 6 interrupts and you should not have this problem.

This library will enable you to use Arduino UNO/MEGA as your FOC brain and you can still do a lot of cool stuff with it even with two motors. Just be aware of the role of thumb if you are using the encoders. 

### Stm32 devices
Stm32 devices are probably the best choice for the FOC implementation MCU. They are very powerful and have many external interrupt pins. They don't loose too much performance due to counting and have much lower loop times making the FOC algorithm much smoother. Stm32 Bluepill can run up to 4 BLDC motors without a problem and Nucleo-64 can run 6+.

The biggest problem of using the STM32 boards in the community is the complexity of programming these devices. But since they have been integrated into the Arduino IDE even this is not a problem any more. Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> code for stm32 devices is exactly the same as for Arduino UNO except the different pin numbers. Therefore I strongly urge you to consider using these devices in your projects because the results are awesome. ðŸ˜ƒ

<blockquote class="info"> Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span> is completely compatible with Nucleo-64 devices. And from the shield version 1.3.1 you will be able to stack 2 of the shields with the Nucleo boards as well.</blockquote>

If you have ported the library to another device or you are searching for help to port it to some specific device don't hesitate to post in [community forum](https://community.simplefoc.com) 

It is always helpful to hear the stories/problems/suggestions of people implementing the code and you might find a lot of answered questions there already!
