# Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span>  <small><i>v1.3.1</i></small>

This is an open-source low-cost Brushless DC (BLDC) motor driver board intended primarily for low-power FOC applications up to 5Amps. The board is fully compatible with the Arduino UNO and all the boards with the standard Arduino headers.
The <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span>, in combination with  the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> provides *user-friendly* way to control BLDC motors both in hardware and software.

## Project example : Reaction wheel inverted pendulum
<iframe class="youtube"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ih-izQyXJCI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
This is a project of designing and controlling the reaction wheel inverted pendulum based entirely on Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> and <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span>

This is a very fun project in many ways, and it is intended:
- Students in search for a good testing platform for their advanced algorithms
- Everyone with a bit of free time and a motivation to create something cool :D

For full documentation of necessary components, design choices and the code please visit the [project docs](simplefoc_pendulum).


## Project example : Steer by wire - bidirectional haptic control examples

This video demonstrates <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span> support for stacking with Arudino UNO and STM32 Nucleo-64 board. As well as support for different sensors magnetic and encoders with relatively large precision span.

The control algorithms implemented in this project are :
- **Steer by wire** (force feedback): two motors with virtually coupled positions
- **Interactive gauge** (haptic velocity control): two motors with virtually coupled position and velocity


For full documentation of the projects setup and the code please visit the [project docs](haptics_examples).
