# Writing the code
Once when you have decided the appropriate [hardware configuration](pads_soldering) of yous board and once you have all the hardware [ready to be connected](foc_shield_connect_hardware): 
- Microcontroller
- BLDC motor
- Position sensor
- Power supply

we can start the most exciting part, coding!

Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span> is fully supported by Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span>, therefore please make sure you have the newest version of the  <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> installed. If you still did not get your owm version of the library please follow the [installation instructions](installation).
